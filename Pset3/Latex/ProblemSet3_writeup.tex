Problem Set 2

\section*{Problem 1}
Figure \ref{fig1} plots total daily NOx emissions in the NBP-participating states.

\section*{Problem 2}
Note: According to Figure 1 in the paper, the NBP participating states include Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. However, since Missouri only entered the market in 2007, I exclude it from the list of NBP states for the proceeding analysis since we are only utilizing 2002 and 2005 data.

\subsubsection*{Part a}
The econometric equation is
\begin{align}
	Y_d = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Summer}_d + \beta_2 \tilde{X}_d + \beta_3 \tilde{X}_d^2 + \epsilon_t
\end{align}
where $Y_d$ is the total daily NOx emissions (in tons) on day-of-year $d$ in 2005, $\text{Summer}_d$ is an indicator equal to one for days between May 1st and September 30th (the ozone season), $\tilde{X}_d = \gamma_d - c$, where $\gamma_d$ is the day of the year and $c$ is the cutoff date - either May 1st or September 30th. The coefficient of interest, $\beta_1$, represents the estimated effect of the NOx Budget Trading Program on NOx emissions at the cutoff date.

\subsubsection*{Part b}
Columns 1--2 of Table \ref{tab1} report the estimated effect of the NOx Budget Trading Program on NOx emissions using the polynomial RD. Using the May 1st (September 30th) cutoff, I find that the NBP led to an average decline in total NOx emissions of 2069.498 (2528.294) tons in 2005 from states participating in the NBP.\footnote{I interpreted ``1 month on each side of the discontinuity'' as $\pm$ 30 days (inclusive) on either side of the cutoff date.} These estimates are statistically significant at the 1\% level.

\subsubsection*{Part c}
Because we are summing total NOx emissions to the daily level in 2005, there is only variation across days within each regression's 2-month sample window. Thus, OLS is computing a difference in means at the cutoff date after flexibly controlling for quadratic trends across the sample period. This difference in means is unweighted and includes all observations in the 30 day window on either side of the cutoff. That is, we are using a rectangular kernel. This seems reasonable since we are summing emissions across states and only using one year of data. Should we desire, we could explore alternate kernel types (e.g,. triangular) to test the robustness of our specification.

The key identifying assumption in this design is continuity, which means that the expected potential outcomes are continuous at the cutoff. This assumption will fail if one or more of the determinants of NOx aside from the NBP (e.g., weather flucuations or economic activity) jumps discontinuously at the cutoff. Our RD estimates will be biased if the continuity assumption is not satisfied.

Lastly, I use heteroskedasticity robust standard errors to obtain unbiased standard errors of the OLS coefficients under heteroscedasticity.

\section*{Problem 3}

\subsubsection*{Part a}

\begin{align}
	Y_d = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Summer}_d + \beta_2 \tilde{X}_d + \beta_3 \tilde{X}_d^2 + \beta_4 \tilde{X}_d \times 
		\text{Summer}_d + \beta_5 \tilde{X}_d^2 \times \text{Summer}_d + \epsilon_d,
\end{align}
where $\text{Summer}_d$ and $ \tilde{X}_d$ are defined as before.

\subsubsection*{Part b}
Columns 3--4 of Table \ref{tab1} report the estimated effect of the NOx Budget Trading Program on NOx emissions using the spline RD. Using the May 1st (September 30th) cutoff, I find that the NBP led to a decline in total NOx emissions of roughly 1835.393 (2701.130) tons in 2005 from states participating in the NBP. These estimates are statistically significant at the 1\% level.

\section*{Problem 4}

\subsubsection*{Part a}
The econometric equation is
\begin{align}
	Y_d = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Summer}_d + \epsilon_d,
\end{align}
where $Y_{d}$ is total daily NOx emissions (in tons) on day-of-year $d$ in 2005, $\text{Summer}_d$ is defined as before, and $\epsilon_d$ is an error term. The coefficient of interest, $\beta_1$, represents the difference in 2005 average total daily NOx emissions in the summer versus the winter from NBP participating states. That is, $\hat{\beta}_1 = (\bar{Y}_{\text{Summer}} - \bar{Y}_{\text{Winter}})$.

\subsubsection*{Part b}
Using this cross-sectional estimator in 2005, I estimate that the NBP reduced total daily summer NOx emissions in 2005 by an average of 3097.434 tons (Column 1, Table \ref{table:CS_DiD}). This estimate is statistically significant at the 1\% level.

\section*{Problem 5}

\subsubsection*{Part a}
The econometric equation is
\begin{align}
	Y_{dt} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Summer}_d + \beta _2\text{Post}_t + \beta_3 \text{Summer}_d \times \text{Post}_t + \epsilon_{dt},
\end{align}
where $Y_{dt}$ is total daily NOx emissions (in tons) on day of year $d$ and year $t$, $\text{Summer}_d$ is defined as before, $\text{Post}_t$ is a binary indicator equal to one for the year 2005 and zero for the year 2002, and $\epsilon_{dt}$ is an error term. The coefficient of interest, $\beta_3$, represents the difference in average total daily NOx emissions in the summer vs winter and before vs after the NBP went into effect in NBP participating states. That is, 
\begin{align*}
	\hat{\beta}_3 = (\bar{Y}_{\text{Summer}, \text{Post}} -  \bar{Y}_{\text{Winter}, \text{Post}}) - (\bar{Y}_{\text{Summer}, \text{Pre}} - \bar{Y}_{\text{Winter}, \text{Pre}}).
\end{align*}

\subsubsection*{Part b}
Using the pre/post DiD estimator, I estimate that the NBP reduced total daily summer NOx emissions in 2005 by an average of 2888.387 tons (Column 2, Table \ref{table:CS_DiD}). This estimate is statistically significant at the 1\% level.

\section*{Problem 6}

\subsubsection*{Part a}
The econometric equation is
\begin{align}
	Y_{id} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Summer}_d + \beta _2 \text{East}_i + \beta_3 \text{Summer}_d \times \text{East}_i + \epsilon_{id},
\end{align}
where $Y_{id}$ is total daily NOx emissions (in tons) in region $i$ (East vs West) on day-of-year $d$, $\text{Summer}_d$ is defined as before, $\text{East}_i$ is a binary indicator equalling one for Eastern states participating in the NBP and zero for Western states, and $\epsilon_{id}$ is an error term. The coefficient of interest, $\beta_3$, represents the difference in 2005 average total daily NOx emissions in the summer vs winter and in the East vs West.\footnote{Following the main analysis of the paper, I exclude Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, Georgia, Mississippi, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont from the regression sample.} That is,
\begin{align*}
	\hat{\beta}_3 = (\bar{Y}_{\text{Summer}, \text{East}} -  \bar{Y}_{\text{Winter}, \text{East}}) - (\bar{Y}_{\text{Summer}, \text{West}} - \bar{Y}_{\text{Winter}, \text{West}}).
\end{align*}

\subsubsection*{Part b}
Using the East/West DiD, I estimate that the NBP reduced total daily summer NOx emissions in 2005 by an average of 3496.941 tons (Column 3, Table \ref{table:CS_DiD}). This estimate is statistically significant at the 1\% level.

\section*{Problem 7}

\subsubsection*{Part a}
The econometric equation is
\begin{align}
	Y_{idt} &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Summer}_d + \beta_2 \text{East}_i + \beta_3 \text{Post}_t + \beta_4  \text{Summer}_d \times \text{East}_i + \beta_5 \text{Summer}_d \times \text{Post}_t  \nonumber \\
	& \quad  + \beta_6 \text{East}_i \times \text{Post}_t + \beta_7 \text{Summer}_d \times  \text{East}_i \times  \text{Post}_t + \epsilon_{idt},
\end{align}
where $Y_{idt}$ is total NOx emissions (in tons) in region $i$ (East vs West), day of year $d$, and year $t$, $\text{Summer}_d$, $\text{East}_i$, and  $\text{Post}$ are defined as before, and $\epsilon_{idt}$ is an error term. The coefficient of interest, $\beta_7$, represents the difference in average total daily NOx emissions in the East vs West, summer vs winter, and before vs after the NBP went into effect. That is,
\begin{align*}
	\hat{\beta}_7 &= [(\bar{Y}_{\text{Summer}, \text{East}, \text{Post}} -  \bar{Y}_{\text{Summer}, \text{East}, \text{Pre}}) - (\bar{Y}_{\text{Winter}, \text{East}, \text{Post}} - \bar{Y}_{\text{Winter}, \text{East}, \text{Pre}}] \\
	& \quad  - [(\bar{Y}_{\text{Summer}, \text{West}, \text{Post}} -  \bar{Y}_{\text{Summer}, \text{West}, \text{Pre}}) - (\bar{Y}_{\text{Winter}, \text{West}, \text{Post}} - \bar{Y}_{\text{Winter}, \text{West}, \text{Pre}})].
\end{align*}

\subsubsection*{Part b}
Using the triple difference estimator, I estimate that the NBP reduced total daily summer NOx emissions by an average of 2911.723 tons (Column 3, Table \ref{table:CS_DiD}). This estimate is statistically significant at the 1\% level.

\subsubsection*{Part c}
I choose to not weight the regressions. I do this because we are interested in the effect of the NBP on average total daily emissions across units affected by the NBP. Although I do not cluster the standard errors, we could consider doing so if we are worried about serial or spatial autocorrelation. For instance, if we were running a state-level season regression rather than an east vs west daily regression, I could consider clustering at the state-season level.

\section*{Problem 8}
For the triple difference estimator in Problem 7, the NBP should affect Eastern states only: $D_{idt} = 1[i=\text{East}] \times 1[d \in \text{Summer}] \times 1[t=2005]$. This assumption might fail if there are spillover effects onto Western states (e.g., wind from the East to the West carrying fewer NOx emissions than usual), although the authors select the control states with this concern in mind. In the DDD estimator, we also allow for non-parallel trends between the East vs West, but require this non-parallelness to be the same during the summer vs winter. That is,
\begin{align*}
	\EX[\Delta Y_{\text{East, Summer}}(0) - \Delta Y_{\text{West, Summer}}(0)] = \EX[\Delta Y_{\text{East, Winter}}(0) - \Delta Y_{\text{West, Winter}}(0)]
\end{align*}
This assumption might fail if there are unobserved seasonal shocks to NBP states after the NBP went into effect (e.g., other regulatory changes that occur during the summer months in NBP states in 2005). 

I believe the DDD estimator is the most reasonable approach to measuring the effects of this
program. The polynomial RD in Problem 2 only uses one year of (post-period) data and, thus, cannot rule out the possibility that NOx emissions in NBP states typically fall during the summer months (specifically, around the cutoff dates) even before the program went into effect, in which case there would be no treatment effect. This specification also imposes a common quadratic time trend on either side of the cutoff dates, which may be a stronger assumption than we are comfortable making. Although the spline RD in Problem 3 allows for different quadratic trends on either side of the cutoff dates, it suffers from the first issue that afflicts the polynomial RD. 

Both RD specifications are likely better identified than the cross-sectional specification in Problem 4 since they are comparing outcomes around 2-month windows of the program start/stop rather than across summer vs winter. The months on either side of the cutoff dates are likely more comparable than summer vs winter. However, the RD specifications only return the local average treatment effect (LATE) during these 2-month windows, whereas we are presumably interested in the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) for the entire summer period when the NBP operates.

Lastly, the parallel trends assumption in the DDD estimator is weaker than those in the DiD estimators, making it more likely to be satisfied in our setting. Specifically, the DiD estimator in Problem 5 requires parallel summer vs winter trends among NBP states before vs after the NBP began operating in 2005:
\begin{align*}
	\EX[Y_{\text{Summer, Post}}(0) - Y_{\text{Winter, Post}}(0)] = \EX[Y_{\text{Summer, Pre}}(0) - Y_{\text{Winter, Pre}}(0)],
\end{align*}
and the DiD estimator in Problem 6 requires parallel summer vs winter trends in 2005 in the East vs West:
\begin{align*}
	\EX[Y_{\text{Summer, East}}(0) - Y_{\text{Winter, East}}(0)] = \EX[Y_{\text{Summer, West}}(0) - Y_{\text{Winter, West}}(0)].
\end{align*}


\section*{Problem 9}
My interpretation of this question is that, instead of running the above regressions to estimate the effects of the NBP program, we are proposing comparing pre-period measured emissions with post-period emissions as prescribed by the caps. If the caps were perfectly binding and we assumed that firms would want to emit as much pollution as they could, then this approach would tell us how much emissions fell during the summer when the NBP is in effect. However, since the NBP is not in effect during the winter, using the caps along will not tell us how emissions changed during that period of time. Moreover, since firms may emit beyond or below their allowances, the prescribed emissions caps will almost certainly not match the actual level of emissions once the NBP went into effect.


\section*{Problem 10}
The consumer’s problem is
\begin{align*}
	\max_{X, f, a} u(X, f, s(c,a)) \text{ s.t. } I + p_w(T-f-s(c,a)) \geq X + p_a a,
\end{align*}
where $X$ is the numeraire good, $f$ is hours of leisure, and $s=s(c,a)$ is health as captured by the number of sick days, which depends on the ambient pollution concentration $c$ and defensive behavior $a$. The budget constraint is comprised of non-labor income, $I$, and labor income, $p_w(T-f-s(c,a))$. We can therefore write the Lagrangian as
\begin{align*}
	\mathcal{L} = u(X, f, s(c,a)) + \lambda(I + p_w(T-f-s(c,a)) - X + p_a a)
\end{align*}
with first-order conditions
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial u}{\partial X} &= \lambda, \\
	\frac{\partial u}{\partial f} &= \lambda p_w \\
	\frac{\partial u}{\partial s} \frac{\partial s}{\partial a} &= \lambda \left[ \frac{\partial s}{\partial a} p_w + p_a  \right] \label{eqn:foc_a}
\end{align}
Recall that the marginal cost of the numeraire good, $X$ , is 1; the marginal cost of leisure, $f$, is $p_w$ (i.e., the hourly wage you give up by not working); and the marginal cost of defensive actions, $a$, is the direct cost, $p_a$, net of the saved costs from taking fewer sick days (i.e., the additional wages that can be earned from taking fewer sick days due to improved health) since $\partial s/\partial a < 0$. Moreover, recall that $\lambda$ is the ``shadow price,'' or the utility gain at the optimum of relaxing the budget constraint by one dollar. Therefore, each first-order condition says that the marginal utility of the good in question equals the shadow price times the marginal cost. In other words, the marginal utility of consuming one additional unit equals the marginal disutility of purchasing one additional unit.

\section*{Problem 11}
Given that the consumer chooses $a$ to maximize their utility, we can write their health production function as $s=s(c,a^*)$. Totally differentiating this with respect to $s$ yields
\begin{align*}
	\frac{ds}{dc} = \frac{\partial{s}}{{\partial c}} + \frac{\partial s}{\partial a} \frac{\partial a^*}{\partial c}
\end{align*}
Rearranging terms, we get 
\begin{align} \label{eqn_dsdc}
	\frac{\partial s}{\partial c} = \frac{ds}{dc} - \frac{\partial s}{\partial a} \frac{\partial a^*}{\partial c}.
\end{align}

\section*{Problem 12}
$\partial s/\partial c$ represents the partial effect of ambient pollution on health as measured by sick days, holding all else equal. $d s/ dc$ represents the total effect of ambient pollution concentration on health, which is the direct effect of pollution on health net of the mitigating effects of defensive behaviors.

 $\partial s / \partial c$ is difficult to estimate both in an experimental and non-experimental setting. In an experimental setting, we would need to randomly expose some people to higher ambient pollution concentrations without allowing them to take defensive actions, which is highly unethical. In the non-experimental case, we would need data on all defensive investments according to the second RHS term in equation (\ref{eqn_dsdc}), which is typically more difficult to obtain than pollution or health data. $ds / dc$ is comparatively easier to estimate because observed health outcomes are already net of defensive behaviors people engage in.


\section*{Problem 13}
First, we can rearrange equation (\ref{eqn_dsdc}) as
\begin{align*}
	\frac{\partial s}{\partial a} = \frac{1}{\partial a^* / \partial c} \left[ \frac{d s}{d c} - \frac{\partial s}{\partial c} \right]
\end{align*}
Substituting this expression for $\partial s/\partial a$ into equation (\ref{eqn:foc_a}), we get
\begin{align*}
	\frac{\partial u}{\partial s} \left( \frac{1}{\partial a^* / \partial c} \left[ \frac{d s}{d c} - \frac{\partial s}{\partial c} \right] \right) &= \lambda p_w \left( \frac{1}{\partial a^* / \partial c} \left[ \frac{d s}{d c} - \frac{\partial s}{\partial c} \right] \right)  + \lambda p_a
\end{align*}
Simplifying and rearranging yields
\begin{align}
	& \frac{\partial u}{\partial s} \left[ \frac{d s}{d c} - \frac{\partial s}{\partial c} \right] = \lambda p_w \left[ \frac{d s}{d c} - \frac{\partial s}{\partial c} \right] + \lambda p_a \frac{\partial a^*}{\partial c} \nonumber \\
	\Leftrightarrow \; & \frac{\partial u}{\partial s} \frac{ds}{dc} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial s} \frac{\partial s}{\partial c} = \lambda p_w \frac{ds}{dc} - \lambda p_w \frac{\partial s}{\partial c} + \lambda p_a \frac{\partial a^*}{\partial c} \nonumber \\
	\Leftrightarrow \; & \lambda p_w \frac{\partial s}{\partial c} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial s}{\partial s}{\partial c} =  \lambda p_w \frac{ds}{dc} + \lambda p_a \frac{\partial a^*}{\partial c} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial s} \frac{ds}{dc} \nonumber \\
	\Leftrightarrow \; & p_w \frac{\partial s}{\partial c} - \frac{1}{\lambda} \frac{\partial u}{\partial s}{\partial s}{\partial c} =  \left(p_w \frac{ds}{dc} \right) + \left( p_a \frac{\partial a^*}{\partial c} \right) - \left( \frac{\partial u / \partial s}{\lambda} \frac{ds}{dc} \right) \nonumber \nonumber \\
	\Leftrightarrow \; & w_c =  \left(p_w \frac{ds}{dc} \right) + \left( p_a \frac{\partial a^*}{\partial c} \right) - \left( \frac{\partial u / \partial s}{\lambda} \frac{ds}{dc} \right).
\end{align}

\section*{Problem 14}
In the model, $p_a$ represents the cost of all defensive behaviors taken against air pollution. It is worth noting that medications alone - which is what the paper uses to measure defensive investments - do not capture the full spectrum of potential defensive investments (e.g., purchasing air filters or limiting time spent outdoors).
